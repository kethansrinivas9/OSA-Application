# OSA-Application

This application is developed using AngularJS, CanvasJS(to display the graphs) and Flask. I have used Node.js to server the static files in the application

Steps to install the project:
1. Clone/Download the repository into your machine
2. Run `npm install` to install all the Node.js dependencies
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the Flask related dependencies
4. Run `node server.js` to start the Front-end
5. Run `python Server/server.py` to start the Back-end
6. You should be able to view the application in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`
